        description: 'Project awaj is one of the major projects of the Aachol Foundation. The main subject of this project is related to cybercrime & cybersecurity, which raises awareness on various issues of cybersecurity as well as provides legal and psychological assistance to the victims, and the initiative to start this project was taken in January 2021.  Aachol Foundation announced the need for ensuring mental health services for Bangladesh citizens. The government of Bangladesh recognizes mental illnesses as among the top ten priority health concerns in the country. If someone is a victim of cybercrime & suffers from mental problems, then this project will help him or her to get out of this situation. This will reduce the number of people suffering from mental problems and people will be aware of their rights. In today\'s society, Cybersecurity is a big issue for internet users. Every day thousands of people are victims of cyberattacks. The issue is making internet users think. That\'s why Project Awaj is working on the nature of the cyberattack and what is the way to get rid of it. Moreover, this project is also working to create awareness among the students or youth who are admitting to cyberbullying or do not know about cybercrime and cybersecurity. So, it will be helpful for the students or youth all over our country.'

        name: 'Project Surfaid',
        description: 'Workplace can play a vital role in maintaining positive mental health but conversely working in a negative ambiance can affect our mental health due to a stressful environment. Oftentimes, we see young employees enter the workforce with little knowledge of corporate life and not many of them being able to deal with pressure in the workplace. Thus, Aachol Foundation has taken the initiative to help and support them and hence the organization has launched Project Surfaid. The main purpose of Project Surfaid is to create opportunities for the youth to expand their skills as well as counseling them on how to maintain a healthy state of mind in the workplace. As we all know how hard skills and soft skills exhibit our productivity,  efficiency and ability to work with others. Many of the young graduates are not being able to get their desirable jobs due to lack of these required skills and knowedge. And some of them go through mental illness for being jobless.  Thereby, through this project Aachol Foundation is trying to help the youth to develop their basic soft and hard skills, which they would be needed to establish a career in the corporate world. Aachol Foundation aims to provide various virtual training programs and workshops on how to make a professional CV, have good  communication, leadership, project, and time management skills to achieve success in the corporate sector along with good mental health. So far two webinars  has been organized by Aachol Foundation in collaboration with Coach Kanchon Sir, under project surfaid. The first webinar was on “Power of happiness: how to build an emotional immune system” and the second was on ‘’The pursuit of happiness: arts of finding your inner- self”. In addition to that, Aachol Foundation has also organized an online workshop on how to ace professional interviews. Now Aachol Foundation has been planning to organize another event on the techniques to improve presentation skills. Therefore, via project surfaid Aachol Foundation has been trying to  make an effort to merge mental wellbeing with learning  professional skills through a future-oriented approach.'

        name: 'Project Happiness',
        description:'Project Happiness is an important unit of the Aachol Foundation which started its journey in July, 2021 with the aim of motivating people towards happiness. Nowadays, happiness has become materialistic and people now think of getting good results and getting new gifts as happiness. So, when they don\'t get good results or don\'t get new gifts, they get frustrated. But in reality the thing called happiness is found through self-knowledge and satisfaction. Originally, the Aachol Foundation launched Project Happiness to help people understand the true meaning of happiness. In this project various webinars, workshops and sessions are organized based on Happiness. By joining these webinars, workshops and sessions, the youth will know the true meaning of happiness as well as how to keep themselves happy by overcoming frustration and also will learn how to be the cause of one\'s own happiness. Moreover, by attending these sessions, they will be able to learn about happiness from reputed and certified mentors and will also receive a certificate as a reward.  For the purpose of informing people about the ways in which they can keep themselves happy, Project Happiness launched its 1st online course called “Mastering The Happiness; Myth To Discover” which ran from 16th September, 2021 to 19th October, 2021. Md Ilyas Kanchan Sir, the only “Certified Happiness Coach” of Bangladesh was present as the mentor in this course.'

Some of them which were launched by the Aachol Foundation recently is the Study Abroad Workshop, Designing Essential Using Different Tools, The Skill Blast.
