Whether it is good or bad, if it is a topic outside of mental health-related, he can also share it. No one will judge them in these matters. And many times it will try to give solutions to many mental problems. I am quoting a story. A few days ago I became hopeless with my personal life. Family, friends, none of this was pulling me. It was as if I had left everything and gone somewhere else. Suicide thoughts kept coming. I left home several times and wandered here and there helplessly. I can see the end of my life. Then I spent some time on Google and social media to relax my mind. Because of this, I could not forget my frustration, loneliness, boredom, painful events in my life, or even share some of the articles and websites. Then suddenly a Facebook group called "Mending Minds" came in front of me. I got a few more groups, but it seemed the best. Then from here, I was able to overcome my frustration and above all loneliness and frustration with free thought sharing and consulting promotion. For which I can thank and appreciate Mending Minds. Maybe mental health professionals, alternative practitioners, parenting, students, businessmen, or anyone can share their stories whenever they want. It can be called a living library. From where only inspiration will come. Encouragement will come, faith will be strong, morale will increase, energy will be boosted.'
