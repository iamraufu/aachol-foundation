From the start, it is working continuously for the members. Every day some articles are posted on the Facebook page of Chapter Eden about mental health and necessary things in day-to-day life. A campaign was launched on behalf of Chapter Eden in four categories where students were encouraged to learn themselves better and be happy in their lives. All participants of the campaign were awarded a certificate. The winner of that campaign will be awarded a book as a prize. We are going to organize a little prize-giving ceremony for the winner. We are preparing for a lot of sessions and campaigns soon. We are so determined for the skill development of the members as well. Already some sessions have been organized such as basic video making, poster creating, creative writing.
